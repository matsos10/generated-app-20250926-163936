## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Note (re: SQL & Docker)
This project is built on a **serverless, Cloudflare-native architecture**. This modern approach offers significant advantages in scalability, performance, and security.
- **Data Persistence**: Instead of a traditional SQL database, we use **Cloudflare Durable Objects**. These provide strongly consistent, stateful storage directly on Cloudflare's edge network, ensuring low latency and data locality for users worldwide. This means a `sql.md` file is not applicable to this project's architecture.
- **Deployment**: The application is deployed directly to **Cloudflare Pages and Workers**. This eliminates the need for managing servers, containers, or virtual machines. As a result, `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files are not required for deployment. The entire deployment process is streamlined and managed through the Wrangler CLI.
This architecture was chosen to align with best practices for building highly performant and scalable web applications.
## üèÅ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.
### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or newer)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) package manager
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/)
### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/nexusdesk_ai_support.git
    cd nexusdesk_ai_support
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    bun install
    ```
3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.dev.vars` file in the root directory and copy the contents of `.env.example`. Fill in your Cloudflare secrets.
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .dev.vars
    ```
    You will also need to update the `name` and `vars` in `wrangler.jsonc` to match your Cloudflare account details.
## üíª Development
To start the local development server, which includes both the Vite frontend and the Cloudflare Worker backend, run:
```sh
bun run dev
```
This command will start the application, typically on `http://localhost:3000`. The frontend will hot-reload on changes, and the worker will restart automatically.
### Available Scripts
- `bun run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `bun run build`: Builds the frontend application for production.
- `bun run deploy`: Builds and deploys the application to Cloudflare Workers.
- `bun run lint`: Lints the codebase using ESLint.
## üöÄ Deployment
This project is designed for seamless deployment to the Cloudflare network.
1.  **Build the application:**
    ```sh
    bun run build
    ```
2.  **Deploy to Cloudflare:**
    ```sh
    bun run deploy
    ```
Wrangler will handle the process of uploading your static assets to Cloudflare Pages and deploying your worker function. After deployment, it will provide you with the public URL for your application.
